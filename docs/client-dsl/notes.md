## Notes

### Blocks in Ruby

Ruby methods may *receive* a block which is simply an anonymous function.  

The following code in Ruby

```ruby
some_method(1, 2, 3) { |x| puts x }
```
is roughly equivilent to this Javascript
```JavaScript
some_method(1, 2, 3 function(x) { console.log(x) })
```
In Ruby blocks may be specified either using `do ... end` or with `{ ... }`

```Ruby
some_method { an_expression }
# or
some_method do
  several
  expressions
end
```
Standard style reserves the `{ ... }` notation for single line blocks, and `do ... end` for multiple line blocks

### Ruby Hash Params

In Ruby if the final argument to a method is a hash you may leave the `{...}` off:

```RUBY
some_method(1, 2, {a: 2, b: 3}) # same as
some_method(1, 2, a: 2, b: 3)
```

### The HyperComponent Base Class

By convention all your components inherit from the `HyperComponent` base class, which would typically look like this:

```ruby
# components/hyper_component.rb
class HyperComponent
  # All component classes must include Hyperstack::Component
  include Hyperstack::Component
  # The Observable module adds state handling
  include Hyperstack::State::Observable
  # The following turns on the new style param accessor
  # i.e. param :foo is accessed by the foo method
  param_accessor_style :accessors
end
```
> The Hyperstack Rails installer and generators will create this class for you if it does not exist, or you may copy the
above to your `components` directory.

Having an application wide `HyperComponent` class allows you to modify component behavior on an application basis, similar to the way Rails uses `ApplicationRecord` and `ApplicationController` classes.

> This is just a convention.  Any class that includes the `Hyperstack::Component` module can be used as a Component.  You also do not have
to name it `HyperComponent`.  For example some teams prefer `ApplicationComponent` more closely following the
Rails convention.  If you use a different name for this class be sure to set the `Hyperstack.component_base_class` setting so the
Rails generators will use the proper name when generating your components.  **[more details...](/rails-installation/generators.html#specifying-the-base-class)**

### Abstract and Concrete Components

An *abstract* component class is intended to be the base class of other components, and thus does not have a render block.
A class that defines a render block is a concrete class.  The
distinction between *abstract* and *concrete* is useful to distinguish classes like `HyperComponent` that are intended
to be subclassed.

Abstract classes are often used to share common code between subclasses.

### Word Count Method

```RUBY
def word_count(text)
  text.downcase                      # all lower case
      .gsub(/\W/, ' ')               # get rid of special chars
      .split(' ')                    # divide into an array of words
      .group_by(&:itself)            # group into arrays of the same words
      .map{|k, v| [k, v.length]}     # convert to [word, # of words]
      .sort { |a, b| b[1] <=> a[1] } # sort descending (that was fun!)
end
```

### Ownership

In the Avatar example instances of `Avatar` _own_ instances of `ProfilePic` and `ProfileLink`. In Hyperstack (like React), **an owner is the component that sets the `params` of other components**. More formally, if a component `X` is created in component `Y`'s `render` method, it is said that `X` is _owned by_ `Y`. As will be discussed later a component cannot mutate its `params` â€” they are always consistent with what its owner sets them to. This fundamental invariant leads to UIs that are guaranteed to be consistent.

It's important to draw a distinction between the owner-owned-by relationship and the parent-child relationship. The owner-owned-by relationship is specific to Hyperstack/React, while the parent-child relationship is simply the one you know and love from the DOM. In the example above, `Avatar` owns the `DIV`, `ProfilePic` and `ProfileLink` instances, and `DIV` is the **parent** \(but not owner\) of the `ProfilePic` and `ProfileLink` instances.

```ruby
class Avatar < HyperComponent
  param :user_name

  render do # this can be shortened to render(DIV) do - see the previous section
    DIV do
      ProfilePic(user_name: user_name)  # belongs to Avatar, owned by DIV
      ProfileLink(user_name: user_name) # belongs to Avatar, owned by DIV
    end
  end
end

class ProfilePic < HyperComponent
  param :user_name
  render { IMG(src: "https://graph.facebook.com/#{user_name}/picture") }
end

class ProfileLink < HyperComponent
  param :user_name
  render do
    A(href: "https://www.facebook.com/#{user_name}") do
      user_name
    end
  end
end
```

### Generating Keys

Every Hyperstack object whether its a string, integer, or some complex class responds to the `to_key` method.
When you provide a component's key parameter with any object, the object's to_key method will be called, and
return a unique key appropriate to that object.

For example strings, and numbers return themselves.   Other complex objects return the internal `object_id`, and
some classes provide their own `to_key` method that returns some invariant value for that class.  HyperModel records
return the database id for example.

If you are creating your own data classes keep this in mind.  You simply define a `to_key` method on the class
that returns some value that will be unique to that instance.  And don't worry if you don't define a method, it will
default to the one provided by Hyperstack.

### Proper Use Of Keys

> For best results the `key` is supplied at highest level possible.  (NOTE THIS MAY NO LONGER BE AN ISSUE IN LATEST REACT)
```ruby
# WRONG!
class ListItemWrapper < HyperComponent
  param :data
  render do
    LI(key: data[:id]) { data[:text] }
  end
end  

class MyComponent < HyperComponent
  param :results
  render do
    UL do
      result.each do |result|
        ListItemWrapper data: result
      end
    end
  end
end
```
```ruby
# CORRECT
class ListItemWrapper < HyperComponent
  param :data
  render do
    LI { data[:text] }
  end
end

class MyComponent < HyperComponent
  param :results
  render do
    UL do
      results.each do |result|
        ListItemWrapper key: result[:id], data: result
      end
    end
  end
end
```
