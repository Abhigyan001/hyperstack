# react.rb

The idea is

1. Take advantage of React.js 's Virtual DOM
2. Establish a higher level of helpers's (rather than write low level DOM)
3. Make Ruby / Rails developers feel like home

## Developling

1. `bundle install`
2. `bundle exec rackup`
3. Open `http://localhost:9292` to run the test

## Notice

* stuff under `example` folder are broken
