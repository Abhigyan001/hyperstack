## 1.0alpha1.6 - 2021-03-29

### New Major Features
+ Now compatible with Opal 1.x and Rails 6.x:  Tested with Opal ~>1.0 + Rails ~>5.0 and Rails ~>6.0, and Opal ~>0.11 and Rails ~>5.0.
+ You can run Hypermodel connections on Redis (instead of ActiveRecord).  This gives about a 10% performance boost, and there will be even better
performance as the Redis adapter is optimized.
+ The `rails-hyperstack` gem now includes a file `hyperstack/server_side_auto_require` that you may require from the `hyperstack.rb` initializer.
This file will add the capability to Rails ActiveSupport Dependencies to automatically look for files in the matching main app sub directory when loaded first from the `hyperstack` directory.  This allows you to leave serverside functionality in the main app subdirectories, and only include definitions relevant to the client side in the `hyperstack` directories.  See https://github.com/hyperstack-org/hyperstack/issues/361 for more info.  ATM requiring this file will set the Rails autoloader mode to :classic.
+ Complete rewrite of Hyperspec with much improved syntax and many new features including ability to use with any Rack application.  See [the docs](https://docs.hyperstack.org/development-workflow/hyper-spec) for details.  But don't worry its all backwards compatible with the old syntax.
+ Much more robust gem installer.


### Breaking Changes
+ [#350](https://github.com/hyperstack-org/hyperstack/issues/350) Moved the server side `after` and `every` methods to an include module.  You are only effected if you are using the `after` or `every` methods on the server.
+ You may encounter some breakage due to configuration changes. Rails and the JS world have changed a lot recently, and its hard to insure that the new Gems will work correctly in all situations without some adjustment to your configuration.  Please report any issues that you encounter.
